  ANSI C and TIFF version
  this version uses FFTW 3 (net about a factor of 2X faster)

  FFTW choses an optimum form of the FFT at run time so there
  is some variation in execution speed depending on what else 
  the CPU is doing during this planning stage

  see:   www.fftw.org

  on Windows file libfftw3f-3.dll must be in the PATH

  on Linux build as:
  g++ -O -fopenmp -o autoslic autoslic.cpp autosliccmd.cpp slicelib.o
                       tiffsubs.o  cfpix.o -lfftw3f

  Transmit an electron wave through a specimen using the
  multislce method with automatic slicing.  Read in the (x,y,z)
  coordinates of the whole specimen and break into slices
  on-the-fly.

  started 24-july-1996 E. Kirkland
  working 19feb-1997 ejk
  added look-up-table vzatomLUT() for 3X-4X increase 
        in speed 23-may-1997 ejk
  put bandwith limit inside trlayer() 1-oct-1997 ejk
  added Gaussian thermal displacements 1-oct-1997 ejk
  removed /sqrt(3) from Thermal rms displacements 
    to be consistent with Int'l X-ray tables 22-dec-1997 ejk
  corrected zmin/max error with thermal displac. 24-dec-1997 ejk
  fixed small aliasing problem 5-jan-1998 ejk
  added unit cell replication option and moved ReadXYZcoord()
    into slicelib.c  11-jan-1998 ejk
  added astigmatism and modify to use different set of
    random offsets on each illum. angle with partial coherence
         5-feb-1998 ejk
  fix typo in z range message with partial coherence and
    thermal vibrations 9-july-1998 ejk
  update memory allocation routines 19-nov-1999 ejk
  change void main() to int main() for better portability
         22-jan-2000 ejk
  fixed bug in zmin/zmax calculation in coherent mode
     (move to after sortByZ() - it was before ) 8-jan-2002 ejk
  add cross section option (in non-partial coherence mode only)
        27-may-2005 ejk
  convet to faster sortByZ() 8-feb-2006 ejk
  move sortbyz() to slicelib.c 5-sep-2006 ejk
  add echo on y position in pixels for xz mode 4-may-2007 ejk
  update data type of nxl,nyl to be consistent with new tiffsubs
     17-jul-2007 ejk
  move xz depthpix save to be after transmit+propagate to get a
     full slice and proper anti-aliasing and also be consisten
     with what you get doing it by hand  and increase possible
     slices output (nz was off by one) 24-jan-2008 ejk
  change propagation range to be whole unit cell not just
     range of atoms to treat sparsely populated spec.
     better (consistent with autostem) 23-mar-2008 ejk
  take small things out of loop in trlayer() 14-may-2008 ejk
  parameterize vzatomLUT() vs r^2 instead of r to avoid a lot of sqrt()
      calls (a little faster)  6-jun-2008 ejk
  move vzatomLUT() to slicelib.c  11-jun-2008 ejk
  convert to GPL 3-jul-2008 ejk
  add Cs5 (and Cs->Cs3) 15-dec-2009 ejk
  get return value of scanf() to remove warnings from gcc 4.4
     and convert to 4 char TAB size formatting 21-feb-2010 ejk
  add parallel computing of a few parts 21-feb-2010 ejk
  start conversion to faster FFTW 24-feb-2010 ejk
  move some things into slicelibW.c to share 6-mar-2010 ejk
  fix sign convention in FFTW 21-mar-2010 ejk
  update comments 4-apr-2010 ejk
  add option to average over many frozen phonon
      configurations 3-aug-2010 ejk
  add multipole aberrations to probe 12-may-2011 ejk
  start conversion to floatTIFF.cpp and C++ 28-may-2012 ejk
  working 3-jun-2012 ejk
  convert to cfpix/fftw class from raw fftw 13-nov-2012 to 21-nov-2012 ejk
  move calculation into a class with separate command line front end
      29-may-2013 ejk
  convert to string message 9-sep-2013 ejk
  change RNG seed argument to referenece so it get updated for 
      successive calls 21-sep-2013 ejk
  move toString() to slicelib from here 28-nov-2013 ejk
